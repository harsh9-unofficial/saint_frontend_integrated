            </h2>
            <p>
              My personal evolution of clothing (& all things consumerism) has
              been 'less and less and less'. I have found that the pieces I
              reach for years after purchase, are the classic shapes in high
              quality fabrics. I wanted to create a brand that designs by these
              principles. I hope you enjoy.

            SAINT acknowledges the Traditional Custodians of country throughout
            Australia and their connections to land, sea and community. We pay
            our respect to their elders past and present and extend that respect
            to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples today.
